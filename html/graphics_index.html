        <div class="text">This section will help you explore through the elements of graphics that you can do with LaTeX. Due to the amount of material,
          we decided to flesh out graphics in its most used tools. This section will cover charts, tables, images and vector drawing.
          At the end of this section, you'll be able to create your own chart, for example a pie-charts, put as many multirow you want in a table and color them, place an image wrapped around a text
          and most importantly, you'll be able to let your creativity flow and draw your mind on LaTeX.<br><br>
          For time reasons, we had to leave out typography. Here's a documentation if you wanna learn more about the argumen:

        <div class="quotebox"><p>Graphics (from Greek γραφικός graphikos, "belonging to drawing") are visual images or designs on some surface,
          such as a wall, canvas, screen, paper, or stone to inform, illustrate, or entertain. In contemporary usage it includes: a pictorial representation of data,
          as in computer-aided design and manufacture, in typesetting and the graphic arts, and in educational and recreational software.
          Images that are generated by a computer are called computer graphics.<br>
          Graphic design may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure,
          flyer, poster, web site, or book without any other element.</p>
