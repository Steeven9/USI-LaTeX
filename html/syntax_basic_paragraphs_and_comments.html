  <h2>Creating paragraphs and new lines</h2>
   <p>In very important documents, such as scientific ones, you do not
    want to keep a simple, basic format. In Latex, for example,
    if you want to start a new paragraph, you have to click the
    "Enter" key twice, and if you write on a new line and not
    start a new paragraph, you can write a backslash (\\) two times,
    after the line previous to the new line. For example,</p>
    <blockquote><code><p>\documentclass{article}</p>
      <p><p>\title{My first Latex Document!}</p>
      <p>\author{Bob Malcom}</p>
      <p>\date{November 2, 2018}</p>
      <br>
      <p>\begin{document}</p>
      <p>\maketitle</p>
      <p>Hello World! This is a very simple, Latex document. \\</p>
      <p>This is a new line \\</p>
      <p>This is another line.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This is a new paragraph.</p></code></blockquote>

<h2>Comments</h2>
  <p>We saw from the code and the  picture of the document, that a new line
    goes simply down a line, while a paragraph gets indented.</p>

    <p>On Latex, it is also possible to insert comments (colored in red), useful
      for remembering what you meant in one of your lines of
      code. Very simply, you type the symbol "%", and start writing the
    comment. When you are finished with the comment, you  press the "Enter" key. Below, for example:</p>
    <blockquote><code><p>\documentclass{article}</p>
      <p>\title{My first Latex Document!}</p>
      <p>\author{Bob Malcom}</p>
      <p>\date{November 2, 2018}</p>
      <br>
      <p>\begin{document}</p>
      <p>\maketitle %Title inserted</p>
      Hello World! This is a very simple
      Latex document. \\ %This is a text, containing the command that lets the following text go down the next line</p>
      <p>This is a new line \\ %This is a text, containing the command
        that lets the following text go down the next line</p>
      <p>This is another new line. %This is a text, containing the command
        that creates a new paragraph (double "Enter" key)</p>
      <br>
      <p>This is a new paragraph. %Final text (in new paragraph)</p>
      <p>\end{document}</p></code></blockquote>




  <p>As you may imagine, comments will not appear
    on the actual Latex document. This is a very useful tool,
    because it makes the coder remember what he meant with
    a particular code, or line of code.
    Are you not so sure about remembering in the future what you have written, or what your code really means?
    Put a % and write your comment!</p>
