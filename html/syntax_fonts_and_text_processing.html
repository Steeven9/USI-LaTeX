    <h2>Bold, Italics and Underlining</h2>
    <p>The concept of the bold, italics and underlining features are
      basic, but useful at the same time. These features will make
    parts of your code stand out and highlight important concepts.
    To write a bold word/sentence, you must insert your text between
    the parenthesis of the command \textbf{text}, to write an italic word/sentence,
    you must insert your text between the parenthesis of the
    command \textit{text}, and finally, to write an underlining word/sentence,
    you must insert your text between the parentheses of the
    command \underline{text}. Fairly easy, right?</p>
    <h2>Emphasizing text</h2>
    <p>We are not done yet, because there is an extra important feature, that may even help some people.
      There is the command \emph{text}, which, at first sight,
      has the same behaviour of the underlining feature, but not fully.
      This command emphasizes the interested text. For example,
      if you start the audio version of your text, the computer
      automatic reader will orally emphasize it, making the text seem
      more important. This feature, for example, helps blind people.</p>
      <br>
    <p>Let's look at an example below of the code and the document,
      including the two topics discussed above:</p>
    <blockquote><code><p>\documentclass{article}</p>
      <p>\title{My first Latex Document!}</p>
      <p>\author{Bob Malcom}</p>
      <p>\date{November 2, 2018}</p>
      <br>
      <p>\begin{document}</p>
      <p>This is a really simple example of how the text
        features will look in Latex.</p>
      <p>This is a \textbf{bold} word, this is a \textit{sentence in Italics},
        this is an \underline{underlined} word, and this
        is an \emph{emphasized} word. This last is, at first
        sight, the same as the sentence in italics, but has the
        job to emphasize the text, most of all during the audio
        reading.</p>
        <p>\end{document}</p>
      </code></blockquote>
