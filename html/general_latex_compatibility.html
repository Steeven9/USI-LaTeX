        <div class="text">There are two versions of LaTeX in widespread use: LaTeX2e and LaTeX 2.09. LaTeX2e is the



        current version of LaTeX since it replaced LaTeX 2.09 in 1994. LaTeX 2.09 is now obsolete and is no longer



        supported but is still used by many people who see no reason to switch to LaTeX2e. If you are a newcomer



        you definitely want to learn and use only LaTeX2e.



        How do you know which version is which? LaTeX 2.09 files begin with the command “\documentstyle”, while



        LaTeX2e files begin with “\documentclass”. Fortunately, when you run the command “latex” on your file, the



        software automatically figures out which version you're using and does the right things.

                    LaTeX documents (.tex) can be opened with any text editor. They consist of plain text and do not

                    and LuaLaTeX.

        <div class="text">LaTeX follows the design philosophy of separating presentation from content, so that



          authors can focus on the content of what they are writing without attending simultaneously to its



          visual appearance. In preparing a LaTeX document the author specifies the logical structure using



          simple, familiar concepts such as chapter, section, table, figure, etc., and lets the LaTeX system



          worry about the formatting and layout of these structures. It still allows manual typesetting



          adjustments where needed. This concept is similar to the use of Cascading Style Sheets to style HTML.



          This approach is defined WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) and it is the difference of working



          with LaTeX or with WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) word-processing as Microsoft Word.



            <br>



            <br>



            The LaTeX system is a markup language that also handles typesetting and rendering.



            LaTeX can be arbitrarily extended by using the underlying macro language to develop custom formats.



            Such macros are often collected into packages, which are available to address special formatting issues



            such as complicated mathematical content or graphics.
