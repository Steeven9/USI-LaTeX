        <div class="firstsubtitle">Versions of LaTeX</div>
        <div class="text">There are two versions of LaTeX in widespread use: LaTeX2e and LaTeX 2.09. LaTeX2e is the
            current version of LaTeX, since it replaced LaTeX 2.09 in 1994. LaTeX 2.09 is now obsolete and is no longer
            supported, but is still used by many people who see no reason to switch to LaTeX2e. If you are a newcomer
            you definitely want to learn and use only LaTeX2e.
            How do you know which version is which? LaTeX 2.09 files begin with the command "\documentstyle", while
            LaTeX2e files begin with "\documentclass". Fortunately, when you run the command "latex" on your file, the
            software automatically figures out which version you're using and does the right things.

                    LaTeX documents (.tex) can be opened with any text editor. They consist of plain text and do not
                    contain hidden formatting codes.

                <li>
                    TeX documents can be shared by rendering the LaTeX file to Rich Text Format (.rtf) or Extensible
                    Markup Language (.xml). This can be done using the free software programs LaTeX2RTF or TeX4ht.
                </li>
                <li>
                    LaTeX can also be rendered to PDF files using the LaTeX extension pdfLaTeX. LaTeX files, containing
                    Unicode text, can be processed into PDFs with the inputenc package or by the TeX extensions XeLaTeX
                    and LuaLaTeX.

                    LaTeX2HTML is a converter written in Perl that converts LaTeX documents to HTML. This way, e.g.,
                    scientific papers, primarily typeset for printing, can be placed on the Web. It is licensed under

        <div class="subtitle">Difference between What You See Is What You Mean and WYSIWYGet</div>
        <div class="text">LaTeX follows the design philosophy of separating presentation from content, so that
            authors can focus on the content of what they are writing without attending simultaneously to its
            visual appearance. In preparing a LaTeX document, the author specifies the logical structure using
            simple, familiar concepts such as chapter, section, table, figure, etc., and lets the LaTeX system
            worry about the formatting and layout of these structures. It still allow manual typesetting
            adjustments where needed. This concept is similar to the use of Cascading Style Sheets to style HTML.
            This approach is defined WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) and it is the difference between
            working with LaTeX or with WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) word-processing as Microsoft Word.
            <br>
            <br>
            The LaTeX system is a markup language that also handles typesetting and rendering.
            LaTeX can be arbitrarily extended by using the underlying macro language to develop custom formats.
            Such macros are often collected into packages, which are available to address special formatting issues
            such as complicated mathematical content or graphics.
