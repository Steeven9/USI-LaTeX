          What is LaTeX?
        </div>
        <div class="text">Roughly speaking, LaTeX is a programming language in the
          same way that.html is a programming language. Both are used to organize
          content in an appealing fashion when compiled. While.html is used for
          websites, LaTeX is generally used for academic documents.
        </div>
        <div class="text">While LaTeX's ability to quickly format math
          equations is a major reason for this, the language can also be used to
          publish <a href="#">books</a>, <a href="#">presentations</a>,
          <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/wikiupload/8/85/TMR-Issue13.pdf"
          target="_blank">
          and even write a program to pilot a Mars Rover</a> (though not recommended).

          A team of Informatics students at Università della Svizzera italiana
          (<a href="https://www.usi.ch/en" target="_blank">USI</a> for short)
          have been tasked to assemble a beginner's guide to LaTeX in the form
          of a website. We hope our work proves useful to you!

          Why use LaTeX instead of Microsoft Word/Google Docs/etc.?
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          To give Word and its contemporaries due credit, they does look less scary
          than LaTeX (at first). These applications are designed to be easily
          interactible on the graphical level; all that's needed to make a table
          bigger is a click and drag of the table corner. This is a design paradigm
          referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG"
          target="_blank">WYSIWYG</a>.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          By and large, these programs start breaking down when your document gets
          large. Word, for example, starts slowing down and crashing as your report
          accumulates more equations, figures, and images. LaTeX avoids this problem
          entirely by handling only the code, and producing an output (compiling)
          separately.
          Other significant advantages include:
          <ol>
            <li><b>Ease of reformatting.</b>
              <ul>
                <li>LaTeX's default style is already easy to read, and future
                modification takes a fraction of the time that it would take in
                Word or elsewhere. Font sizes are relative, new sections can be
                made to always start on a new page, image resizing and placement
                is generally "auto-corrected" by the compiler (it has good
                judgment)... the list goes on.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Bibliographical management.</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Given the usual attributes for a source citation, e.g. author,
                  year published, date of access, etc.), LaTeX has a package that
                  instantly produces a bibliography in MLA, APA, or other specified
                  style. Check out our guide
                  <a href="html/packages_index.html">here</a>.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Fantastic equation editing.</b>
              <ul>
                <li>Rather than using default text to typset an equation, LaTeX can
                produce beautiful equations, matrices, 2D & 3D graphs, all without
                slowing down your computer (ahem, Microsoft Equation Editor). Check
                out another homecooked guide of ours
                <a href="math_preamble.html">here</a>.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Modularity.</b>
              <ul>
                <li>If there is a need for it, there's almost certainly a LaTeX
                  extension (called a package) already created for it. Check out
                  some of our favorites <a href="packages_index.html">here</a>.

         I've never used LaTeX before, and need to re-format a research paper

         <b>Step one:</b> Breathe! This is totally doable.

          <b>Step two:</b> Use our guide! This website is built to be accessible
          to a typical Bachelors student, and the website sections build on one
          another nicely. Start at the
          <a href="general_installation.html">installation guide</a> to determine
          how to get LaTeX running on your computer shortly, begin with our
          <a href="syntax_First_document.html">basic syntax</a> section, and proceed
          from there. Skimming through our whole website to get to the sections
          most necessary for you takes 30 minutes at most, with maybe an equal
          amount of time needed to copy, paste, and modify our example code. :-)
