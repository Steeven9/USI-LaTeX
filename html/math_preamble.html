          If at this point the user still doesn't understand why they should use
          latex to write academic papers, or if the user find it tedious to learn
          or unnecessarily complicated, especially in comparison to Programms like
          Word and Page, this part should manage to change their mind. <br>
          If in other programms, that may seem easier than latex, we want to write
          a mathematical expression this could result in a lot of time needed
          to do so, in the other hand even a fairly complex expression won't take
          much time with Latex.<br>
          Let's make an example to clarify:<br>
          I would like to invite the reader to write the following formula with
          Word.<br>
          x = φ<sup>2</sup><br>
          It took roughly five seconds to do it using latex
          <div class="codebox"><b>CODE</b><hr>
              <p>$x=\phi^2 $</p>
          </div>
             and i guess it didn't take much longer to do <thead>
            same for Word. But this was a simple expression.
            Let's now try something more complex:<br>
            F<sub>1</sub>=1, F<sub>2</sub>=1, F<sub>n</sub>=F<sub>n-1</sub>+F
            <sub>n-2</sub> &#8704;n&#8712;N,n&#8805;2<br>
            It still took only a few seconds to write it with Latex
            <div class="codebox"><b>CODE</b><hr>
                <p>$F_1=1, F_2=1\quad F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2} \quad\forall n\in
                \mathbb{N}, n \geq 2$</p>
            </div>
            With other programms this may take way longer
            or even be impossible.<br>
            Now the appeal of using Latex for mathematical papers should be obvious.
            <br>
            Latex, on top of being fast, it is also fairly simpler, in regard of
            mathematical enviroment, more flexible and more powerful when compared
            to other writing programms. Not only expression can be represented but
            also matrices, geometrical figures, graphs and much more.
            <br>
            It is also worth noting that the packages amsmath and tikz are needed
            for the most complex things that will be shown in this section.<br>
            <img src="../media/img/matrixex.png" class="centerimagesbig">
            <img src="../media/img/geoex.png" class="centerimagesbig">
            <img src="../media/img/graphex.png" class="centerimagesbig">
            <br>
            Not only the basics necessary to write simple expressions will be
            explained but also more complex stuff, like how to make matrices,
            how to plot function on a plane, and how to make geometrical figures.
            We hope to give enough tools to then be able to write a paper that
            concern itself with elementary math.
            <br>On top of that at the end of each page the reader
            will find some exercise to check their progress.
