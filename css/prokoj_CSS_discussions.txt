SA1 Suggestions


For CSS:

• Would using class tags on <p>, <h1>, etc. be easier or harder to manipulate later?
• We can avoid using line breaks, have margin built in to headings (subtitles)

• font to sans serif? would make it a bit easier to read?
• black bars on the left and right side of the background?
	• since background is light, dark sides would be less distracting for a reader
	• we can decide whether static/dynamic
	• may not be a problem w/ sidebar afterwards, but would still be asymmetric
		• solution 1: background image has black bars on side built-in
		• solution 2: content section itself has min & max width
		• e.g. 400 -> 800 px?
